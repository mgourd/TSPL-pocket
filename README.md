TSPL-pocket
===========

Re-typesetting [The Scheme Programming Language](http://scheme.com/tspl4/)
4th edtion into epub format by markdown(pandoc).

We use pandoc_markdown as middle format because it's easy to convert to other
formats. The markdown files are generated by pandoc without `--parse-raw`, so
word level references are lost, but section level references are remained.

## TODO

1. Typeset math using latex to replace gifs.
